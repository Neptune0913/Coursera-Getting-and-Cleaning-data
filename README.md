# Getting and Cleaning data - Final Project

This is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning data Coursera course. The dataset being used is [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

###In this project, the following steps are carried out:

1. Download and unzip the dataset, use R to read the files needed;
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set;
4. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
5. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###The project includes the following files:

- `README.md`
- `CodeBook.md`: describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
- `run_analysis.R` contains all the code (using R Studio) being used to finish the project
- `tidy.txt` the dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
